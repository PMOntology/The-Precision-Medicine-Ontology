PMOï¼šThe Precision Medicine Ontology

The Precision Medicine Ontology (PMO) is an open source ontological knowledge representation model about the data in precision medicine domain.
It contains 10 top classes such as Biochemical Pathway, Anatomical Structure, Phenotype and Abnormality, Disease, Gene Product, Chemical and Drug, Mutation, Gene, Cell and Biologic Function, which are described by 93 semantic relationships between them. PMO is an extensible ontology aimed to integrate the terms in field of precision medicine, and all of the terms and relationships in PMO can apply in text mining or knowledge base building. The PMO can be accessed via downloading from the website, and which supports multiple data sharing formats include RDF, OWL and XML.

PMO is now supported by the Precision Medicine Knowledge Base Project. The Precision Medicine Knowledge Base, which is the National Key Research and Development Program of China, aims to construct a reliable knowledge base of precision medicine for massive data analysis and integration. The PMO supports the identification and semantic integration of gene, disease, drug, mutation, phenotype, pathway, and so on, which are the key scope of the data in the precision medicine (PM) knowledge base.

According to the ten top classes we defined, we selected and obtained the terms and hierarchy from well-known biomedical ontologies and thesaurus, such as DO, NCIt, UMLS, GEO, HPO, Drugbank, ClinVar, and NCBI Gene. These terms and hierarchies are integrated together according to specific rules into a new standard ontology structure which is more applicable to precision medicine.

In the future, the scope of PMO will be expanded by taking more semantic type into account, such as exposome, samples and clinic trials, which can make the outcome be translated into clinical practice better.
